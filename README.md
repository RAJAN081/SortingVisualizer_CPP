# ðŸŽ® SortingVisualizer_CPP

A **real-time sorting algorithm visualizer** written in **C++ using SDL2**.  
This tool lets you **see how sorting algorithms work step-by-step**, with animated bars and keyboard controls â€” like watching DSA come alive ðŸ’¡.

## ðŸ“š What It Does

This visualizer graphically displays how sorting algorithms arrange elements.
